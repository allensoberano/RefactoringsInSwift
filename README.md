# Refactorings In Swift

 I created these Swift examples as I was reading Martin Fowler's Book: [Refactoring](https://amzn.to/3OwHvzD)
 
 Although the book is written in Javascript I wanted a reference to how it would look it Swift and a quick reference to refer too when I need it and thought it might be useful to others as well.
